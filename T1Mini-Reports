TEAM 1 Mini-Reports
------------------------------------------------------
  
  1) What was done?
We had a team meeting on Wednesday discussing the content of the Requirement Specification. 
We made notes what should we write about and what is the purpose of it. After that each of us
wrote a particular part of the Requirements Specification and team leader will have the draft published
by Thursday night. We started discussing what kind of software will we use and how we will get the
result, however we didn't really think of anything specific.
  
  2)What issues/blockers did we face?
We postponed the meeting that we eventually had on Wednesday for 2 times - some students were unable to
come to university on Monday or Tuesday and we didn't really want to have a meeting online. We also
realised that we don't know who will be in TEAM3 so it's not clear to whom we need to talk in order to
know what we will need to create.
  
  3)Goal for next week:
*Finish the Requirements Specification;
*Create an understanding of which tools will we use;
*Distribute our roles in creating software;
*Ideally it would be great to undestand what kind of information we will receive from TEAM1 and in what
appearance it should be delivered to TEAM3;

  4)Status: GREEN
  
  1) What was done?
*We finished the content of our Requirement Specifications. Fixed issues we had last week and added more
content. Started writing it in Latex. 
*We talked with other teams and created a mutual agreement of working with Java, so it is easier to merge
code and parse results between teams.
*We decided that we will create an API to implement our task.
*Give an example of a json file as our result to the other team leaders.
*We had a particular success in distributing our jobs during the creation of Requirement Specification - 
everyone successfully finished their responsibility and we managed to finish everything a week before deadline
(maybe not complete Latex part)
  
  2) What issues/blockers did we face?
*Deciding what we want to build.
*Communicating with everyone and mutually agreeing that we are all working with Java.
*Converting our Specification into Latex :) Was the hardest problem so far
  
  3) Goal for next week:
*Finish (if not yet) converting Specification document into Latex
*Deciding what exactly we need in a JSON file from TEAM1
*Generate ideas on how we will split TEAM3 work

  4) Status: GREEN
  
  2022/10/07
  1) What was done?
*Polished our requirement specification
*Found a mathematical solution to our task (future logic of the program)
*Exchanged information with the rest of the team leaders and give them, like a json
purpose
  
  2) What issues/blockers did we face?
*Again, working with latex and converting everything according to standards
*Going through mathematics of 3d space and vectors to find how we will solve our task

  3) Goal for next week:
*Start coding (at least basic main method and maybe draft of other classes)
*Get more into the contents of JSON, how and which info we will use

4) Status: GREEN






week 21/10/2022

What was done?
  *Talk to the other team leaders about what we had done this week
  *Use area 1 half done to program everything in java and in json, with a DTO.
  *We held a meeting on Tuesday 10/18 with the rest of teamleaders. I tried to teach them what a DTO was but in the end we agreed to do it in a json, implementing it in a 3D model, for the ease of the other leaders of the teams.
  *We began to divide the tasks for each team 1 member.
  *We discussed about what program we shall use to create the diagrams for the next deliverable.
  *We did the UML class Diagram, and some sequence diagrams

What issues/blockers did we face?
  *discuss with the other leaders whether to do it in a DTO, or in a json, implementing it in a 3D model, 
   for the ease of the other leaders we have decided to do it in json
  *with my team we were also debating in which technology to work the diagrams, 
   if in visual paradigm or in starUML, personally we chose starUML, because it is 
   much easier to navigate and does not require any license activation
 
Goals for the next week
  *Distribute our roles
  *Try to finish much of the following practice.
  *Start thinking about the high-level overview of our team's deliverables internals and the automated testing. 
  *Create both the context diagram and the deployment diagram.
  *Ask the teacher a lot about what could be wrong and correct it
